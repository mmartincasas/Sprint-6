# Budgets Project

## 📄 Description

This application was generated using **Angular CLI 18**. Its function is to generate a budget for a web service:

- We can select three services (SEO, Ads, Web). For the web service, we can also select the number of pages and languages.
- Once the budget is chosen, we can save it along with the client’s information (name, phone number, and email). This information will be validated.
- At the bottom, we find the list of generated budgets, which can be sorted by date, amount, or name. We can also search for them by name.
- Finally, the URL is updated according to the generated budget, so it can be shared with others before being finalized.
